# Pastey

Little program to paste information with custom hotkeys. For example, ctrl+alt+1 would paste "hello" while ctrl+alt+2 would paste "bye".

## Install

- Add pastey.exe to your PATH so you can run it from a terminal.
- Create a config file with your hotkeys and data to paste using the proper sintax. (View keys.config for an example)
- Run `pastey C:/path/to/file.config`
